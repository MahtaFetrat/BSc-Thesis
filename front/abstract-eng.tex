Stroke is known as the second leading cause of death worldwide. This dangerous disease can cause permanent and irreversible damage to those affected. Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke in the early stages is of utmost importance. The ASPECTS score is a criterion for evaluating stroke severity based on brain CT images. However, diagnosing this score on images in which the damaged areas may not be visible is challenging, even for human experts. This has led to numerous studies on automated ASPECTS scoring in recent years. Automated ASPECTS scoring methods can aid specialists in determining the severity of the stroke and therefore increase the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment method selection. This study proposes a systematic solution for ASPECTS score diagnosis based on deep learning methods. The proposed method shows superior results compared to similar studies and could contribute to future research.
