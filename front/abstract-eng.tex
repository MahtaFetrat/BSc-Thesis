Stroke is known as the second leading cause of death worldwide \cite{donkor2018stroke}.
This dangerous disease can cause permanent and irreversible damage to individuthose affected.
Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke in the early stages is of utmost importance.
The ASPECT score is a criterion for evaluating the severity of stroke based on brain CT images.
However, the diagnosis of this score on early images, in which the damaged areas may not be clearly visible, is a challenging task even for humnan experts.
This has lead to numerous studies on automated ASPECT scoring in recent years.
Automated ASPECT scoring methods can aid specialists in determining the severity of stroke and therefore increase the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment method selection.
This study proposes a systematic solution for ASPECT score diagnosis based on deep learning methods.
The proposed method shows prominent results compared to those of similar studies and could be a valuable contribution to future research.
