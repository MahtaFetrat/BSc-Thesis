Stroke is known as the second leading cause of death in the world.
This dangerous disease can cause permanent and irreparable damage to those affected.
Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke in its early stages are of paramount importance.
The ASPECT score is a criterion for evaluating the severity of stroke on CT images.
However, correctly diagnosing and assessing the severity of stroke on initial images, where damaged areas may not be clearly visible, is even challenging for experts in this field.
In this study, an automatic ASPECTS detection solution based on deep learning methods is presented that can assist specialists in determining stroke severity and improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment method selection.
This study proposes a systematic method for pre-processing brain CT images that can be used in other studies on brain images. Furthermore, a deep neural network based on transfer learning is designed, and its performance is evaluated on available data, yielding satisfactory results.
